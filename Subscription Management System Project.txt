Subscription Management System

The aim of the project is to create a subscription management system that supports JSON and text files,
utilizing an abstract factory to handle various file formats. Users can subscribe to various services.

Project Assumptions:

    We will have different types of objects: Users, Subscriptions, Services.
    Data about users, subscriptions, and services will be stored in JSON or TXT files.
    We will use the abstract factory design pattern to handle different file types.
    The system will process data and generate reports on user subscriptions.

Class Division:

    FileReader - Interface for reading files.

    JsonFileReader and TxtFileReader - Classes implementing FileReader.

    FileReaderFactory - Abstract factory for creating FileReader objects.

    UserService - Class managing users and their subscriptions.

    User, Subscription, Service - classes representing users, subscriptions, and services.

Key Features of the Project:

    Reading data about users, subscriptions, and services from files (JSON and TXT) using the FileReaderFactory class.
    Creating User, Subscription, and Service objects based on the read data.
    Adding the read objects to a list in the UserService class.
    Implementation of a function allowing users to subscribe to a particular service.
    Implementation of various functions in UserService, such as:
        Searching for subscriptions for a specific user.
        Finding users subscribed to a particular service.
        Generating reports on active subscriptions.
